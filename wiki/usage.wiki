== Commands ==
GTRobot provids two command style, global command style and interactive command style.
All commands are case ingored.

GTRobot uses the head character '/' or ':' to indentify Global commands. '/' was also used by the _*[http://coders.meta.net.nz/~perry/jabber/confbot.php Google Talk: Conference Bot]*_, it is truely convenient. The reason using ':' is the '/' does not work in some jabbar client, like Gaim. Maybe some guys will use them to access GTRobot.
